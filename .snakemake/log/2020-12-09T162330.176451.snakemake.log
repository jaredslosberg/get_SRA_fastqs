MissingOutputException in line 1 of /home/jared/workflows/get_SRP_fastqs/Snakefile:
Job completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds:
{project_accession)_out/SRP258962_accession_list.txt
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
